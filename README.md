# Vitamin Android (beta)

[![Build Status](https://app.bitrise.io/app/62ac2962b2dd627a/status.svg?token=GlcHGXAWV2T4IItZiT43_A&branch=main)](https://app.bitrise.io/app/62ac2962b2dd627a)

> Decathlon Design System üé®

Android Decathlon Design System is based on Material Design components described on the [official
documentation](https://material.io/) and developed in a
[library](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-android) maintained by
Google developers and designers.

But these native components are overridden to respect Decathlon's Visual Identity. You'll find
the design specifications and technical information for supported platforms by Decathlon on
[decathlon.design](https://www.decathlon.design/). If you are interested by a sample,
you can install a demo with `sample` module in the technical project.
