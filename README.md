> Decathlon Design System üé®

Android Decathlon Design System is based on Material Design components described on the [official
documentation](https://material.io/) and developed in a
[library](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-android) maintained by
Google developers and designers.

But these native components are overridden to respect Decathlon's Visual Identity. You'll find
the design specifications and technical information for supported platforms by Decathlon on
[decathlon.design](https://www.decathlon.design/). If you are interested by a sample,
you can install a demo with `sample` module in the technical project.

## üöÄ Getting Started

In the style of your application, you just need to specify `Theme.Decathlon` as parent.

```xml
<style name="AppTheme" parent="Theme.Vitamin" />
```

And specify this style in your Android Manifest file as style of your application or one of your
activity.

```xml
<manifest
    ...>

    <application
        ...
        android:theme="@style/AppTheme">

        <activity
            ...
            android:theme="@style/AppTheme" />
    </application>
</manifest>
```

If you want more information about the integration, please see the official documentation or
the sample. All links in the Documentation section of this page.
